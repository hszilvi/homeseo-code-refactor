# Overview
This is the solution of the first week challange. In this challange I had to make at least 10 commits to github, change the tags in html, added comments to the code, checked accessability and SEO, made css more synoptic.

## My_process
I used the given starter code and worked with HTML and CSS. I used gitBash/SSH key to clone the starter package from the bootcamp gitLab site. 
I used gitBash to commit all the changes I made on the project using git a. / git commit -m '' / and git push commands. 
I used the recommended links to understand HTML tags and attributes. 

### Built_with
HTML, CSS
For checking my code I used HTML validator (W3School) and my browser extension for accessability evaluation. 

## What_I_learned
After this practise I became confident in using git Bash and better understand HTML tags. 

### Continued_developement
- I still need to learn more about SEO aspects,
- need to start using git branches to improve my github knowledge.
